<H1>IOOS Documentation Pages</H1>

<H2>Introduction</h2>

This is an extremely basic demo top level page.  Constructed in a browser window on github. Written directly in HTML. Appears automatically on the github page. The link to the page is 

Very simple workflow: 
<nl>
  <it>just make links to the places where the documentation lives</it>
  <it>add an about and a contacts section</it>
  <it>hand it over to a web developer, and have them add the look and feel</it>
  
</nl>

This demo is going to be very simple and just point to other nearby pages that have the document sites.
