=======================

This is the README for the repository [github.com/duncombe/duncombe.github.io](http://github.com/duncombe/duncombe.github.io). The repository contains the content of the website 
[http://duncombe.github.io/](http://duncombe.github.io/). The text in this README.md does not reach the website.

## Purpose of this test

To demonstrate how a top level static HTML document (such as [http://duncombe.github.io/index.html](http://duncombe.github.io/index.html) or 
[http://ioos.github.io/index.html](http://ioos.github.io/index.html)) might link to 
repositories and web-pages under the same user account or even under another account. The top level web-page might be maintained 
strictly statically, while the others might be updated more dynamically by changing content locally and running a web-builder tool such as Hugo or Pelican beefore pushing to a gh-pages branch. Still others might be completely automatic, such as a web-page built by Jekyll on github. A good resource for understanding what happens in building and deploying a website is [http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/).
